# Persistent data structures - good for UI

This is the example code for a presentation delivered at RubyFuza 2014. The slides are available on [slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/danieroux/rubyfuza-2014)

# How

Install [Lein](http://leiningen.org) and then do:

- lein cljsbuild auto
- Open index.html in your browser

# Using LightTable

LightTable will give you the best experience of working with the code live.

The bottom of core.cljs have a few statements that is fun to execute on a live page, which is what I demonstrated at RubyFuza.
